# 🏡 House Price Prediction  

🚀 My **first Machine Learning internship project** — predicting California house prices using **20,640 real housing records**!  

---

## 🔍 Project Highlights  
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with visualizations  
- ⚙️ **Feature Engineering** (ratios, coastal proximity, population density, etc.)  
- 🧮 **Linear Regression Model** as baseline predictor  
- 📈 Evaluation using **R², MAE, RMSE**  

---

## 💡 Key Insights  
- 💰 **Median income** is the strongest predictor of house prices  
- 🌊 Houses closer to the **coastline** are significantly more expensive  
- ⏳ **House age** shows a non-linear relationship with prices  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- 🐍 Python  
- 📊 Pandas · NumPy · Matplotlib · Seaborn  
- 🤖 Scikit-learn  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps  
- 🔹 Experiment with advanced models (**Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost**)  
- 🔹 Hyperparameter tuning for better performance  
- 🔹 Deploy as a **Streamlit/Flask web application**

## ✨ Learning Outcomes  
This project helped me understand the **end-to-end ML workflow**:  

📥 Data → 🔍 Explore → ⚙️ Engineer → 🤖 Train → 📉 Evaluate → 🎨 Visualize
