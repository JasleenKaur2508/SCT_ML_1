🏡 Advanced House Price Prediction
🚀 My first internship ML project — predicting California house prices using 20,640 real housing records!

🔍 What’s Inside?
✅ Data Exploration & Visualizations
✅ Smart Feature Engineering (ratios, coastal proximity, etc.)
✅ Linear Regression Model
✅ Model Evaluation with R², MAE, RMSE

📊 Cool Insights
💰 Income strongly influences house prices
🌊 Houses near the coast are significantly more expensive
⏳ House age shows a non-linear impact on price

🛠️ Tech Stack
🐍 Python
📊 Pandas · NumPy · Matplotlib · Seaborn
🤖 Scikit-learn

🚧 Next Steps
🔹 Experiment with advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
🔹 Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy
🔹 Deploy as a web app with Streamlit/Flask

🙌 My Takeaway
This project taught me the end-to-end ML workflow:
📥 Get Data → 🔍 Explore → ⚙️ Engineer → 🤖 Train → 📉 Evaluate → 🎨 Visualize

🔥 A solid first step into my Machine Learning journey — many more creative projects on the way!
